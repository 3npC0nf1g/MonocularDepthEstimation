### **Step 2: Data Preparation**
1. Select an appropriate dataset:
   - **Options:** KITTI, CityScapes, or NYU Depth V2.  
   - Ensure dataset contains 2D RGB images with corresponding depth maps.  
2. Preprocess data:
   - Resize images for uniformity.  
   - Normalize pixel values and split data into training, validation, and testing sets.  
3. Augment data (optional) to enhance model robustness.  

**Deliverable:** Preprocessed dataset ready for model training.

### **Step 3: Model Selection and Training**
1. Select candidate models for depth estimation:
   - **Models to explore:** MiDaS, MonoDepth2, and DPT (Dense Prediction Transformer).  
2. Implement the selected models using frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.  
3. Train the models on the preprocessed dataset.  
   - Optimize hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size).  
   - Use loss functions such as L1, L2, or SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).  
4. Validate model performance on the validation set.

**Deliverable:** Trained depth estimation model.

### **Step 4: Point Cloud Generation**
1. Use depth maps from the trained model to reconstruct 3D point clouds.  
2. Convert depth values into 3D coordinates using camera intrinsic parameters.  
3. Visualize the generated point clouds using tools like Open3D or MeshLab.  

**Deliverable:** Visualized and exportable 3D point cloud representations.

### **Step 5: Evaluation and Testing**
1. Assess depth estimation performance using metrics:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)  
2. Evaluate point cloud quality:
   - Mean Average Precision (mAP) for object detection tasks.  
3. Test the generated point clouds in a multimodal network for 2D+3D object detection.  

**Deliverable:** Quantitative performance evaluation with graphs and tables.
